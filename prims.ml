(*
   This module contains code to generate the low-level implementation of
   parts of the standard library procedures.
   The module works by defining a hierarchy of templates, which call each other
   to form complete routines. See the inline comments below for more information
   on the templates and the individual routines.

   Note that the implementation below contain no error handling or correctness-checking
   of any kind. This is because we will not test your compilers on invalid input.
   However, adding correctness-checking and error handling *as general templates* would be
   rather simple.

  (* This is the most basic routine template. It takes a body and label name, and
     creates the standard x86-64 bit routine form.
     All other templates and routine-generation functions depend on this template. *)

  (* Many of the low-level stdlib procedures are predicate procedures, which perform 
     some kind of comparison, and then return one of the constants sob_true or sob_false.
     Since this pattern repeats so often, we have a template that takes a body, and a type
     of condition to test for jump, and generates an assembly snippet that evaluated the body,
     and return true or false, depending on the type of condition. *)

       mov rax, SOB_TRUE_ADDRESS
       .return:";;

  (* 
     Many of the predicates just test some kind of equality (or, equivalently, if the 
     zero flag is set), so this is an auxiliary function dedicated to equality-testing predicates. 
     Note how we make use of currying here.
   *)
  let return_boolean_eq = return_boolean "je";;
  
  (* 
     Almost all of the stdlib function take 1 or more arguments. Since all of the variadic procedures
     are implemented in the high-level scheme library code (found in stdlib.scm), we only have to deal
     with 1,2 or 3 arguments.
     These helper functions inject instructions to get parameter values off the stack and into registers
     to work with.
     The argument register assignment follows the x86 64bit Unix ABI, because there needs to be *some*
     kind of consistency, so why not just use the standard ABI.

     *** FIXME: There's a typo here: PVAR(0) should be rdi, PVAR(1) should be rsi, according to the ABI

  let make_unary label body = make_routine label ("mov rsi, PVAR(0)\n\t" ^ body);;
  let make_binary label body = make_unary label ("mov rdi, PVAR(1)\n\t" ^ body);;
  let make_tertiary label body = make_binary label ("mov rdx, PVAR(2)\n\t" ^ body);;

  (* All of the type queries in scheme (e.g., null?, pair?, char?, etc.) are equality predicates
     that are implemented by comparing the first byte pointed to by PVAR(0) to the relevant type tag.
     so the only unique bits of each of these predicates are the name of the routine (i.e., the label), 
     and the type tag we expect to find.
     The implementation of the type-queries generator is slightly more complex, since a template and a label
     name aren't enough: we need to generate a routine for every (label * type_tag) pair (e.g., the routine 
     `is_boolean` should test for the T_BOOL type tag).
     We have a list of pairs, associating each predicate label with the correct type tag, and map the templating 
     function over this list. Note that the query template function makes use of some of the other templating 
     functions defined above: `make_unary` (predicates take only one argument) and `return_boolean_eq` (since 
     these are equality-testing predicates).

  (* The rational number artihmetic operators have to normalize the fractions they return,
     so a GCD implementation is needed. Now there are two options: 
     1) implement only a scheme-procedure-like GCD, and allocate rational number scheme objects for the 
        intermediate numerator and denominator values of the fraction to be returned, call GCD, decompose
        the returned fraction, perform the divisions, and allocate the final fraction to return
     2) implement 2 GCDs: a low-level gcd that only implements the basic GCD loop, which is used by the rational 
        number arithmetic operations; and a scheme-procedure-like GCD to be wrapped by the stdlib GCD implementation.
    
     The second option is more efficient, and doesn't cost much, in terms of executable file bloat: there are only 4
     routines that inline the primitive gcd_loop: add, mul, div, and gcd.
     Note that div the inline_gcd embedded in div is dead code (the instructions are never executed), so a more optimized
     version of prims.ml could cut the duplication down to only 3 places (add, mul, gcd).
   *)
  let inline_gcd =
    ".gcd_loop:
     and rdi, rdi

     idiv rdi
     mov rax, rdi
     mov rdi, rdx
     jmp .gcd_loop	
     .end_gcd_loop:";;

  (* The arithmetic operation implementation is multi-tiered:
     - The low-level implementations of all operations are binary, e.g. (+ 1 2 3) and (+ 1) are not 
       supported in the low-level implementation.
     - The low-level implementations only support same-type operations, e.g. (+ 1 2.5) is not supported
       in the low-level implementation. This means each operation has two low-level implementations, one
       for floating-point operands, and one for fractional operands.
     - Each pair of low-level operation implementations is wrapped by a dispatcher which decides which 
       of the two implementations to call (by probing the types of the operands).
     - The high-level implementations (see stdlib.scm) make use of a high-level dispatcher, that is in charge
       of performing type conversions as necessary to satisfy the pre-conditions of the low-level implementations.
     
     Operations on floating-point operands:
     -------------------------------------
     The implementations of binary floating point arithmetic operations contain almost identical code. The
     differences are the name (label) of the routines, and the arithmetic instruction applied to 
     the two arguments. Other than that, they are all the same: binary routines which load the values
     pointed at by PVAR(0) and PVAR(1) into SSE2 registers, compute the operation, create a new sob_float
     on the heap with the result, and store the address of the sob_float in rax as the return value.
     This allows us to easily abstract this code into a template that requires a label name and its matching
     arithmetic instruction (which are paired up in the op_map).

     Operations on fractional operands:
     ----------------------------------
     The addition and multiplication operations on rational numbers are similar to each other: both load 2 arguments,
     both deconstruct the arguments into numerator and denominator, both allocate a sob_rational to store the result
     on the heap, and both move the address of this sob_rational into rax as the return value. The only differences 
     are the routine name (label), and the implementation of the arithmetic operation itself.
     This allows us to easily abstract this code into a template that requires a label name and its matching
     arithmetic instruction (which are paired up in the op_map).
     
     Unlike in the case of floating point arithmetic, rational division is treated differently, and is implemented by
     using the identity (a/b) / (c/d) == (a/b) * (d/c).
     This is done by inverting the second arg (in PVAR(1)) and tail-calling fraction multiplication (`jmp mul`).

     Comparators:
     ------------
     While the implementation of the Comparators is slightly more complex, since they make use of `return_boolean`,
     the idea is the same as the arithmetic operators.
     A couple of things to note:
     - `eq.flt` can collapse to a bitwise comparison (like in the case of integers in C), while `eq.rat` involves
       comparing the numerator and denominator separately, due to our fraction representation using 128 bits
       and not 64 bits.
     - `lt.flt` does not handle NaN, +inf and -inf correctly. This allows us to use `return_boolean jl` for both the
       floating-point and the fraction cases. For a fully correct implementation, `lt.flt` should make use of
       the `ucomisd` opcode and `return_boolean jb` instead (see https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/ucomisd for
       more information).
